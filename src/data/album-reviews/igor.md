  The album opens with a distorted synthesizer drone, immediately setting a
  gritty, unpolished tone. "IGOR'S THEME" isn't just an intro; it's a statement
  of intent. The percussion is dry, heavy, and hits you right in the chest.

  Then suddenly, we shift gears. "EARFQUAKE" brings in that soulful, pleading
  aesthetic. This is the radio hit, but it fits perfectly in the narrative. The
  chords are lush, contrasting with the rough vocals.

  By the time we get to "I THINK", the groove is undeniable. It feels like a
  deconstructed pop song from the 80s, run through a broken tape deck.
